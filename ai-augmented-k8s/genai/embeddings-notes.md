Embeddings Notes

- Embeddings transform text into vectors for semantic search and similarity matching.
- Use embeddings to index logs or alerts and perform nearest-neighbor lookup for incident context.
- Typical flow: ingest logs → filter/normalize → create embeddings → store in vector DB → run similarity queries.
